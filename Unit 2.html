    <h1>Unit 2</h1>

<p>1.1 For the website design I have choosen a very single website design that I might inprove later on I have used the HTML code to to structure my page with paragraphs my some of my deails I've even added a link to my trello broad and I have linked a picture to the website and I have later included a background colour for the web site to make the page stand out.
    .</p>
<p>1.5 For website constraint I had a look at a few webistes on the subject matter and it says that copywrite exisits so that web are not copying from each other and that they are created from scratch because websites can be used ti make monney and every major company has a website and own domain names for the webiste.</p>   </p>

<p>1.6 For website accessibility you will need to structure and organise the website so its easily acessable and add in colour blind features and have a name that can easily find your site using a google search.</p>

<p>1.7 For appropriate file types for websites HTML is the standard file code ofr making webiste that can link in other links and other types of files such AVI files for video and audio format and DOC for Microsoft Word documents and GIF which stands for Graphics Interchange Format</s></

<p>Here's a screen shot of the website while its viewed in google chrome
