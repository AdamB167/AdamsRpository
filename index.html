<h1 class="Adamsheaders">Unit 1</h1> 

<p>Hello my name is Adam Buckingham I have worked along time with computers and I have developed It and office based skills over the years but I’ve never had much experience with coding and I’m willing to give it a try.</p>

<p>1.1 The purpose of using IT in a modern business is to use hardware and software for accomplishing various tasks such as communication via email and other messaging services and for production like how I I used to make CD/DVD content and making it accessible for customers and printing out documents and DVD covers and cases or using coding to make or customise software.
</p>

<p>1.2 For completing digital projects you will need knowledge of the hardware and software of what you will be using and have had training to and as well as someone to teach you on how to use the tools provided, and of course have a working PC/apple mac with the correct software loaded on it for you to complete the task and that you have the correct methods needed to complete the task that has been assigned to you and for what tools you will use like for example MS word for a word document and powerpoint for a presentation.</p>

<p>1.3 I will think on a title subject and think about what colour back ground and images that I will think of using and what the theme of what the website will look like and my planning will be based on how quickly and easily I can make it.</p>
<P>

<P>1.4 There quite a few risks with digital projects for example. If you encounter a hardware failure like a hard drive is corrupted for damaged and there is no back up you will lose your work forever and there is a change that a file be damaged if isn’t saved correctly and it its digital content online it has a chance of being hacked or stolen.</P>

<p>1.5 For which IT systems that I would use I would use a PC system that I would be the most familiar with and depended on the sort of project that I would be working on I would used a updated version of MS word for a word project and I would use a competent PC with the correct hardware for use in video editing and if I’m uploaded content to a website I would need a decent broadband connection so that upload speed was done quickly and provided for customers.</p>

<P>1.6  For the project that I will be working the Apple Mac is designed for coding and it was the suitable software already installed and ready for use and having Trello will be useful for organising my project and getting it ready and structured and the software and coding will allow me to produce what I want and how it will be made.</P>

<p>1.7 The three most significant project constraints or schedule, cost and scope are sometimes known as the triple constraint or the project management triangle. A project's scope involves the specific goals, deliverables and tasks that define the boundaries of the project. This new data protection regulation puts the consumer in the driver’s seat, and the task of complying with this regulation falls upon businesses and organisations. Otherwise, you’re failing to comply.
    What falls under GDPR compliance Well, GDPR applies to all businesses and it can protect your your content from copy write. </p>

<h1>Website review</h1>

<p>For my website that I have made I used visual studio code to make it and I added the code to make the head titles and I added the paragraphs which contained my bio and basic information, I wasn’t very happy with the tools as I have had a better experience with dreamweaver which allowed me to make and edit website and it would make the code for me, I also used Trello for helping me plan my website.</p>

<p>I do think that the tools were appropriate in the designed of the website the code allows you to  customised and change the website to the design that you want it and you can use the open live server option to see what it looks like online so you can make amendments when needed and Visual studio code helped me in designing the website and it gave me the tools and options to allow me to make it.</p>

<p>For the strengths of my website I would say that its strengths that its basic and easy to ready and it isn’t clogged up with unnecessary images and clutter and I have added some decent images to it</p>

<p>For weakness I was very basic and its that well presented and I struggled to improve and  the Unit 2 link isn’t in the correct position and I could have tried to add some boarders around the text and images to make it more presentable, and as well I could of tried more colours to spice up the text.</p>

<p>For further improvements I could have made to the website I could have added some gif files to make it look better and I could have tried to used a background of the website instead of a white bland screen.</p>

<p>I have review those outcomes and they are fit for the purpose.</p>

<h1>Brief Scenario</h1>

<p>3.1 For the benefits of IT tools you can take your time and designed and easily correct mistakes with no paper waste and you can save projects for you to work on later and its offers more precision and you can save your work with other for them to add further tweaks to the project.
</p>

<p>3.2 I think if you knew more about Visual studio code and I had a few more years to practice I think that could of designed a better website that had more features, I this was a team exercise I think it could have been better with one person building the website and the other provided feedback and quality control and the other person could do research and get images for use in the website.</p>


<p>For improved productivity and efficiency if a project had a ready made template that could be easily customised would speed up progress and having more detailed instructions to help instructed the person making the project would improve productivity.</p>

<p>3.3 If I were to work on this again here’s what I would do again, I would use Dreamweaver to help me build it on a Windows PC as I’m more used to that hardware and software and it would have been done much and quicker and easier and I would have done this assignment in teams and I would have gotten other people’s input and creative ideas for helping me design the website.</p>

<p>3.4 For testing digital solutions I would allow the website live and I would test it in a variety of web browses to see how the website looks on different web browses so that anyone can access the webpage and their isn’t any problems as you could need to show a client the webpage and I would test out the links in the website to make sure that their isn’t any broken links and the website is functioning correctly. </p>
